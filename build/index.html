				<h1>An unexpected party</h1>
				<p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a <a href="#url">perfectly round door like a porthole</a>, painted green, with a shiny.</p>
				<h2>Yellow brass knob</h2>
				<p>In the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with <strong>panelled walls</strong>, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coatsthe hobbit was fond of visitors.</p>
				<p>The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hillThe Hill, as all the people for many miles round called itand many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. <em>No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage</em>. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and.</p>
				<h3>Meadows beyond</h3>
				<p>Sloping down to the river. This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.</p>

				<p>This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.</p>

				<h4>Roast mutton</h4>
				<p>Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used.</p>
				<blockquote><p>Far over the misty mountains cold<br/>To dungeons deep and caverns old<br/>We must away ere break of day<br/>To seek the pale enchanted gold</p></blockquote>
				<p>The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped.</p>
				<p>Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (but with never a thank-you he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him.</p>
				<h5> Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!</h5> 
				<p>He said to himself, thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age!</p>
				<p>So be put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up.</p>
				<h6>Nice little breakfast</h6>
				<p>In the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze.</p>
